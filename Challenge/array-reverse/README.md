## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Discuss Why. What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Create function call reverseArray take an array as input, Declare variable equal 0, Declare variable hold length of the input array -1 , Loop through the array, while looping For every ietration swap the current index with the alternative from the end, Stop when you reach the middle than return the array.

Big O Time--> O(n)

Big O space--> O(n)
