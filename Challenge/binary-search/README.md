# Binary Search of Sorted Array
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the value of the search key, or -1 if the element is not in the array.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Discuss Why. What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Create function call BinarySearch take an array and a search key as input, check if the first input in an array, Declare varible called low equal zero, Declare varbile called high equal the last index of the array, Do a while loop until low be bigger than high or until return, Declare varible called mid equal low + (high - low)//2 , while looping check if arr[mid] equal the search key if it is true return mid , do elif arr[mid] was smaller than search key add 1 to mid, else subtract 1 from high, while looping if the first if statment came true it will return the index value if it came false until the while loop stop it will return -1
Big O 

Time--> O(log n)

space--> O(1)
